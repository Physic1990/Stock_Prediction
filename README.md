# Stock_Prediction
This is a class Project for Data Science.

## My goal:
The goal is to analyze the stock trend of Apple after the year 2022, utilizing historical data from the period between 2020 and 2021.
For collecting data on Apple stock, I developed a Python program utilizing Yahoo Finance data extraction. The programallows users to specify a date range for data retrieval. I opted for this approach over platforms like Kaggle or Yahoo Finance due to the project's potential expansion. 

## Introduction:
The objective is to analyze Apple's stock trend post-2022 using data from 2020-2021. Despite initial assumptions, characterizing and collecting stock data proved challenging due to its vast and diverse
nature. For predictive analysis, factors like Date, Open price, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume are considered but it can be changed in future looking at its potential.
